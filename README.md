# CompTIA A+
No need to pay for anything other than exam. Professer Messer has ample videos on youtube.

# CompTIA Network+

I used Prfoesser Messer again since he has a very solid free course. He provided all his videos and audio recordings which I would just listen too while working out. I however did buy his training notes book and use it to this day from time to time.

# CompTIA Server+

I didnt think this test was hard at all. I used a local VirtualBox setup with Windows Server 2016 and just practiced different things I was reading on the exam breakdown. I watched a course on Skillport and ITProTV

# Amazon Web Services Certified Cloud Practitioner

# CompTIA CASP+

# Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)

I am still working on tackling this monster. Its a very huge english test after you understand the content. I can talk to you all day about the content but its interprepting the convuluted stuff ISC2 puts in this test that makes it challenging and adaptive. 
By far the best place for realistic questions is a combination of CCCure and Luke Ahmed's place. Boson is really not a good resource.
